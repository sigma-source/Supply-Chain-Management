# Supply Chain Profit Prediction Project

This project involves building a machine learning model to predict profit margins in supply chain operations using data preprocessing, feature engineering, and deep learning techniques. The project focuses on identifying the key drivers of profit and providing actionable insights to optimize supply chain efficiency.

## Features
- **Dataset Analysis**: Data cleaning, normalization, and feature extraction.
- **Neural Network Model**: A deep learning model with fully connected layers to predict profit margins.
- **Visualizations**: 
  - Loss curves for model evaluation.
  - Scatter plot comparing actual vs. predicted profit margins.
  - Correlation heatmap for feature importance analysis.
- **Model Saving**: The trained model is saved as an HDF5 file for future use.

## Dataset
The dataset contains features related to:
- Product details (e.g., type, price, stock levels, etc.).
- Supplier information (e.g., name, location, lead time, etc.).
- Logistics (e.g., shipping times, costs, transportation modes, etc.).
- Performance metrics (e.g., defect rates, inspection results, etc.).

## Requirements
The following Python libraries are required:
- `pandas`
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`
- `seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `tensorflow`

## Key Outputs
- **Model Performance Metrics**:
  - Mean Squared Error (MSE)
  - R2 Score
- **Visualizations**:
  - Loss Curves: Training vs. Validation loss.
  - Actual vs. Predicted Profit Margins.
  - Correlation Heatmap of Features.

## Future Improvements
- Include more advanced features for predictive analysis.
- Implement other machine learning algorithms for comparison.
- Automate hyperparameter tuning.
- Integrate additional datasets for broader insights.
